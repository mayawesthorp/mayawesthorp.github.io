        <h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
        <p>This project will examine female board representation in companies across Europe 
                and whether there is any correlation between reaching equality in terms of males and females 
                holding seats on the board of a company and the success of the firm. Throughout the project, 
                I will observe how gender equality on boards varies between country and sector and I will 
                look to explore if there is a relationship between this and success of firms, using measurements 
                including share price growth and market capitalisation.</p>
        <h3>Female board representation across Europe</h3>
        <p>This map of Europe visualises the percentage of seats on boards of the largest publicly listed 
                companies that are held by females.</p>

            <h3>Is female board representation correlated with market capitalisation?</h3>
            <p>One way to measure success is by market capitalisation. As each country has a different number 
                of publicly listed companies, I divided the total market capitalisation by the number of publicly 
                listed countries and ran a regression against the percentage of seats on boards held by females.</p>
            <script>
                var myChart3 = "chart3_marketcap.json"
                vegaEmbed('#Chart3', myChart3);
            </script>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart3"></div>
            <p>As the chart shows, there is a somewhat positive correlation between market capitalisation and 
                female board representation.</p>
                <p>I also ran this regression using Python. Link to

            <h3>Focusing on the U.K.</h3>
            <p>The U.K. specialises in the financial services industry, which is typically known for its lack of 
                female representation. The Financial Times collected data on gender equality from 50 of the UK's 
                biggest banks, insurers, asset managers and professional services firms.</p>

            </script>
            <div class="chart" id="Chart4"></div>
            <p>The chart highlights that, although most companies are employing a roughly equal number of males and 
                females, not one company has reached equality in senior positions.</p>

            <h3>Is female board representation correlated with share price growth?</h3>
            <p>The FTSE Women in Leaders Review annually collects data on gender equality in top 100 firms in the U.K.
                Using the data from the 2021 review and the five year share price growth for the firms in the top 100,
                I ran a regression to see whether share price growth and female board representation are correlated.

            <h3>What do investors think?</h3>
            <p>Despite there being no correlation between share price growth and female board representation, a study
                by Northwestern University found that gender equality does make a difference to the decisions investors 
                make. They asked 389 investors to bet on whether or not a stock price would increase, telling them that the 
                company either had gender diversity above or below average.
