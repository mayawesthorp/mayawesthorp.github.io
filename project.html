                            This project aims to examine gender equality in companies across Europe and whether there is any 
                            correlation between gender equality and firm's success. Throughout the project, I will measure 
                            gender equality, looking at both employment and leadership, and make comparisons between countries 
                            and sectors. I will look to see if there is a relationship specifically between female board
                            representation and firm success, using measurements such as share price growth and market 
                            capitalisation.

                    <h3>Is female board representation correlated with market capitalisation?</h3>
                    <p>
                        One way to measure 'success' is using market capitalisation. To ensure fair comparison between countries, 
                        I used average market capitalisation per firm, running a regression against the percentage of seats on boards 
                        held by females. There is positive correlation of 0.18, which is statistically significant at the 95% 
                        significance level, however, this is not a strong correlation.
                    </p>
                    <p><i>I also ran this regression using Python. Link to the

                        Annually, the FTSE Women in Leaders Review publishes a report with data on the gender equality statistics in 
                        leadership positions of the top 100 firms in the UK. Although the report cites the positive impact on 
                        increased gender equality on financial performance, this linear regression shows no detectable correlation 
                        between female board representation and share price growth.

                    <h3>Challenges with data collection and data cleaning</h3>
                    <p>The biggest challenge I faced in data collection was obtaining statistics from the FTSE Women Leaders 
                        Review, which is a PDF document. I condensed the 70-page document into the 4 pages with the data I 
                        needed and imported 'tabula' on Google Colab in order to scrape the PDF, which did not work on my 
                        laptop but fortunately was successful on another device. Once the document was scraped, there was some 
                        manual cleaning necessary which I did in Excel.
                    </p>
                    <p>Furthermore, I faced challenges when scraping the Financial Times data for the fourth chart. Initially, 
                        I struggled to scrape the correct data that I needed, but eventually was able to use 'pandas' and 
                        'beautifulsoup' successfully. I then used Google Colab to clean the data.
                    </p>
                    <p>Using Google Colab, I created an API loop to extract the employment rates data from the ONS website. I used 
                        Excel for basic calculations, such as needing to divide the total stock market capitalisation by 
                        the number of publicly listed companies in each country to ensure comparison between countries was fair.

                            <p>
                                Although the results suggest that there is little to no correlation between female board representation 
                                and stock prices or market capitalisation, this does not rule out a relationship between gender diversity 
                                and the success of firms. Firstly, there is an extensive range of measures and definitions of firm success that 
                                can be used, and this project only considers two of these measures. Secondly, the increase in gender diversity 
                                in firms is relatively new and it is likely that it will take time for the impact of this to be reflected in 
                                the performance of firms. To analyse the relationship further, I would want to observe firms undergoing changes 
                                in their gender diversity figures, and test the differences in their performance. Furthermore, I would want to 
                                continue looking at the relationships of market capitalisation and share price growth with female board representation 
                                over longer periods of time. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To conclude, although Europe is certainly taking steps to improve gender diversity, especially in leadership 
                                positions, there is still a long way to go before we reach equality and can fully judge the impact of this on 
                                the success of firms, both financially and non-financially.</p>
