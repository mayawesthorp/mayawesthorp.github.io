                <h2><u>Introduction</u></h2>
                <p>This project will examine female board representation in companies across Europe 
                and whether there is any correlation between reaching equality in terms of males and females 
                holding seats on the board of a company and the success of the firm. Throughout the project, 
                I will observe how gender equality on boards varies between country and sector and I will 
                look to explore if there is a relationship between this and success of firms, using measurements 
                including share price growth and market capitalisation.</p>

            <h3>Female board representation across Europe</h3>
            <p>This map of Europe visualises the percentage of seats on boards of the largest publicly listed 
                companies that are held by females. It is immediately clear that Western European countries tend to
                have higher female board representation than Eastern European countries, with France having the 
                highest percentage of females holding board positions, at 45.3%.
            </p>
            <p><i>Note: The countries with a percentage of zero are countries for which there was no data on 
                their female board representation statistics.

            <h3>Is female board representation correlated with market capitalisation?</h3>
            <p>One way to measure success is by market capitalisation. As each country has a different number 
                of publicly listed companies, to ensure fair comparison, I divided the total market capitalisation 
                by the number of publicly listed countries and ran a regression against the percentage of seats on 
                boards held by females. It is evident that, although there is a positive correlation coefficient of 
                0.18, which is statistically significant at the 95% significance level, this is not a strong correlation.
            </p>
            <p><i>I also ran this regression using Python. Link to the

            <h3>Focusing on the U.K.</h3>
            <p> Using a Financial Times article regarding the underrepresentation of women in senior positions in 
                the financial services industry in the UK, I created this bubble chart which compares the percentage 
                of employees that are female with the percentage of senior positions held by females. To gather this 
                data on gender equality from 50 of the UK's bigget banks, insurers, asset managers and professional 
                services firms, I scraped the Financial Times website. The chart highlights that, although most companies 
                are hiring a roughly equal number of males and females, not one company has reached equality in senior 
                positions.

            <h3>Is female board representation correlated with share price growth?</h3>
            <p>Annually, the FTSE Women in Leaders Review publishes a report with data on the gender equality statistics
                in leadership positions of the top 100 firms in the U.K. To obtain the data, I scraped the report, which
                comes in PDF form, and collected data on the five year share price growth for these firms. I ran a linear
                regression to estimate whether these two measures are correlated. The results show that there is no detectable 
                correlation between the two variables, although the next chart will suggest that the perceived wisdom is that
                higher female board representation does have a positive impact on the likelihood of firm success.

            <h3>What do investors think?</h3>
            <p>Despite there being no correlation between share price growth and female board representation, a study
                by Northwestern University found that gender equality does make a difference to the decisions that investors 
                make. They asked 389 investors to bet on whether or not a stock price would increase, telling them that the 
                company either had gender diversity above or below average. When the investors were told that a company had
                above average gender diversity figures (meaning that female representation in the company was higher than 
                average), 77% of investors predicted a rise in the stock price, whereas when the investors were told that the 
                gender diversity figures were below average, this percentage fell to 25%. This implies that investors not only 
                consider gender diversity figures when making investment decisions, but also that they believe that higher female 
                representation increases the likelihood of the firm succeeding.

            <h3>Challenges with data collection and data cleaning</h3>
            <p>The biggest challenge I faced in data collection was obtaining statistics from the FTSE Women Leaders 
                Review, which is a PDF document. I condensed the 70 page document into the 4 pages with the data I 
                needed and imported 'tabula' on Google Colab in order to scrape the PDF, which did not work on my 
                laptop but fortunately was successful on another device. Once the document was scraped, there was some 
                manual cleaning necessary which I did in Excel.
            </p>
            <p>Furthermore, I faced challenges when scraping the Financial Times data for the fourth chart. Initially, 
                I struggled to scrape the correct data that I needed, but eventually was able to use 'pandas' and 
                'beautifulsoup' successfully. I then used Google Colab to clean the data.
            </p>
            <p>I used Excel for basic calculations, such as needing to divide the total stock market capitalisation by 
                the number of publicly listed companies in each country to ensure comparison between countries was fair.

                    <h2><u>Conclusion</u></h2>
                    <p>Examining firm success is inherently difficult because there is a broad range of measures and definitions 
                        that can be used. Looking at success using purely financial measures does not offer the full picture but
                        does highlight that there is a positive impact of having an equal board in terms of gender. More female 
                        representation in senior positions means a greater diversity in the decision making of a company as well 
                        as new ideas, which can only benefit a firm, and is evidently important to investors. Europe as a whole 
                        is taking steps towards achieving gender parity on boards in firms, but there is undoubtedly still a long 
                        way to go.
