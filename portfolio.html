        <h1>Maya Westhorp - Portfolio</h1>
        <h2>Homework 1</h2>
        <p>Set up home page and embed two charts.</p>
        <h3>Inward FDI</h3>
        <p>My first chart looks at foreign direct investment into the UK.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart1"></div>

        <h3>Bank Rate</h3>
        <p>My second chart looks at interest rates in the UK.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart2"></div>

        <h2>Homework 2</h2>
        <p>Add two charts of IMF lending, with the second chart "improving" the data.</p>
        <h3>IMF lending</h3>
        <p>This bar chart displays total IMF credit outstanding for all members from 1984 to 2022.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart3"></div>

        <h3>IMF lending as a percentage of GDP</h3>
        <p>This bar chart displays IMF credit outstanding as a percentage of GDP from 1984 to 2021.
            To calculate the percentage, I divided the total IMF credit by world GDP.
        </p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart4"></div>
        <p>The second chart shows that the "riskiest" year for markets was 1984 when IMF credit
            outstanding as a percentage of GDP was at its peak.
        </p>

        <h2>Homework 3</h2>
        <p>Add a chart using Python.</p>
        <h3>Female representation in parliaments</h3>
        <p>This chart shows the proportion of seats in national parliaments that are held by women from 1997 to 2021.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart5"></div>

        <h2>Homework 4</h2>
        <p>Add a chart using a scraper in Python</p>
        <h3>Highest scores by batting position</h3>
        <p>This chart shows the highest innings totals scored by each batting position.</p>
        <div class="chart" id="Chart6"></div>
        <p> I chose this chart because there was no csv link to the data so a scraper was useful to obtain the data.
